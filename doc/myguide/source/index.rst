Welcome to Docs as Code
=======================

If you buy a car or a construction set for a wardrobe, the user manual
or the building instruction will be shipped with the product. Also
software, bought on a CD, has a handout or handbook.
Your Open Source software should also has a manual. And should do it
something better :-)
