to check and build the documents.

Translation Platform
--------------------

In the chapter :ref:`zanata` it's described, how Zanata can help us
to translate text strings in differenz languages.

Publishing
----------

Compiled HTML pages can served on our own webserver (see :ref:`lxdcontainer`)
Or we use the pretty online service :ref:`Readthedocs`)

.. _lxdcontainer:

LXD Container
-------------

To build our own sphinx build and translation platform, we simple use
`LXD Container <https://www.ubuntu.com/containers/lxd>`__.
If your LXD environment is initialized, just do it::

    lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 zanata
    lxc exec zanata -- bash

Of course, any other Ubuntu system can be used.
